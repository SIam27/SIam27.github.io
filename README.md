### Visual design summary
Evey pages started from wireframing. From there, we created visual design for each page and then created the html files. The goal was to create simple html pages from the visual designs created earlier. As each page was getting its shape, some modifications needed to be done to the visual designs for functionality and requirements. We have recieved feedback from our professor in each step and improved the pages. Current pages are still underconstruction and functionalities are getting added regularly.
